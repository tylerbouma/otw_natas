Upon logging into this level we are told "Access disallowed. You are not logged in."... There must be something telling the site whether or not we are logged in.
It doesn't look to be HTTP header, but once we take a look at the cookies, we find something called "loggedin".
It's currently set to 0, but we can edit the value to 1 and refresh the page.
